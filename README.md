# ngraph.native

_This fork contains additional node bindings_

C++ implementation of force-based layout from ngraph. This is equivalent to
[ngraph.offline.layout](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.offline.layout).
Unfortunately I don't have bindings to nodejs (yet).

If you want to use it, run `./compile-demo` on your linux box.

If you prefer xCode - use [xcode demo](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.native/tree/master/demo/ngraph.native.demo)

My C++ is very much rusty, please feel free to contribute if you find something
to improve.
